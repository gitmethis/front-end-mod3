* The first row's largest and smallest values are 2 and 8, their difference is 6.
* The second row's largest and smallest values are 0 and 3, their difference is 3.
* The third row's difference is 7.

In this example, the spreadsheet's checksum would be `6 + 3 + 7 = 16`.

What's the checksum for the following?

```js
var data = [
  [409, 194, 207, 470, 178],
  [454, 235, 333, 511, 103],
  [474, 293, 525, 372, 408],
  [428, 4321, 2786, 6683, 3921],
  [265, 262, 6206, 2207, 5712]
]
```
